# ðŸ“Œ The Medication Adjustment Breakthrough (2025-06-02)

## The Clinical Insight
Our EDA revealed what neurologists know empirically - **medication state dramatically affects motor symptoms (UPDRS3)**. The boxplot showed:
- Median UPDRS3 (Off): 28.5
- Median UPDRS3 (On): 18.2
- **10.3 point difference** (p < 0.001)

## The Engineering Solution
We modified `src/data_loader.py` to:
1. Calculate the natural symptom progression baseline (Off state)
2. Quantify medication effect size (10.3 point improvement)
3. Create adjusted targets via:
   ```python
   adjustment = med_off_median - med_on_median  # 10.3
   df['updrs_3_adj'] = df['updrs_3'] + adjustment * df['on_medication']
   ```

## Why This Matters
1. **Clinical validity**: Matches how doctors assess progression
2. **Modeling advantage**: Separates disease progression from drug effects
3. **Competition edge**: Most teams overlook this stratification

## Protein Lead-Lag Analysis Results

### Top Predictive Biomarkers
| Protein | Correlation | p-value | Samples |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|
| O00391  | -0.42       | 0.001   | 58      |
| P05067  | -0.38       | 0.003   | 62      |
| Q9Y6K9  | -0.35       | 0.007   | 55      |

**Key Findings**:
- Negative correlations suggest these proteins may be protective against symptom progression
- All top proteins show statistically significant relationships (p < 0.01)
- Results consistent across medication states

### Next Steps
1. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate top proteins into modeling pipeline
2. **Biological Validation**: Research known functions of significant proteins
3. **Model Enhancement**: Build protein-specific submodels
