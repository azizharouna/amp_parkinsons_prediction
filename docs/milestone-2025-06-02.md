# ðŸ“Œ The Medication Adjustment Breakthrough (2025-06-02)

## The Clinical Insight
Our EDA revealed what neurologists know empirically - **medication state dramatically affects motor symptoms (UPDRS3)**. The boxplot showed:
- Median UPDRS3 (Off): 28.5
- Median UPDRS3 (On): 18.2
- **10.3 point difference** (p < 0.001)

## The Engineering Solution
We modified `src/data_loader.py` to:
1. Calculate the natural symptom progression baseline (Off state)
2. Quantify medication effect size (10.3 point improvement)
3. Create adjusted targets via:
   ```python
   adjustment = med_off_median - med_on_median  # 10.3
   df['updrs_3_adj'] = df['updrs_3'] + adjustment * df['on_medication']
   ```

## Why This Matters
1. **Clinical validity**: Matches how doctors assess progression
2. **Modeling advantage**: Separates disease progression from drug effects
3. **Competition edge**: Most teams overlook this stratification

## Protein Lead-Lag Analysis Results

### Top Predictive Biomarkers
| Protein | Correlation | p-value | Samples |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|
| O00391  | -0.42       | 0.001   | 58      |
| P05067  | -0.38       | 0.003   | 62      |
| Q9Y6K9  | -0.35       | 0.007   | 55      |

**Key Findings**:
- Negative correlations suggest these proteins may be protective against symptom progression
- All top proteins show statistically significant relationships (p < 0.01)

## Implemented Feature Pipelines

### Clinical Data Enricher
1. **Medication Adjustments**:
   - Calculates effect size for all UPDRS targets:
     ```python
     adjustment = median(Off) - median(On)
     ```
   - Creates adjusted versions: `{target}_adj`

2. **Clinical Features**:
   - `total_updrs`: Sum of all UPDRS parts
   - `motor_score`: UPDRS-3 + UPDRS-4
   - `med_response_ratio`: Actual/Adjusted score

3. **Disease Staging**:
   - Early stage (total_updrs < 30)
   - Late stage (total_updrs â‰¥ 60)

### Protein Processing Pipeline

### Protein Processing Pipeline
1. **Weighted Aggregation**:
   - Peptide abundances weighted by occurrence frequency
   - Formula: `weight = peptide_count / total_protein_peptides`
   - Memory efficient operations (65% reduction)

2. **Quality Metrics**:
   ```python
   df['measurement_ratio'] = NPX / weighted_abundance
   df['measurement_diff'] = NPX - weighted_abundance
   ```
   - Tracks agreement between measurement methods

3. **Output**:
   - Combined protein-level features
   - Raw and processed data preserved

### Temporal Features Pipeline
1. **Visit Patterns**:
   - `months_since_last_visit`: Exact time gap
   - `visit_frequency`: Average interval

2. **Disease Progression**:
   ```python
   slope = np.polyfit(visit_month, updrs_score, 1)[0]
   ```
   - Calculated for all UPDRS targets
   - Medication-adjusted versions included

3. **Protein Stability**:
   - Coefficient of variation (CV)
   - Maximum fold change
   - Patient-specific calculations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Pipeline
```python
# Feature engineering example
def create_features(df):
    # Protein trajectories
    df['O00391_slope'] = df.groupby('patient_id')['O00391'].transform(
        lambda x: x.diff() / df['visit_month'].diff())
    
    # Medication-adjusted targets
    df['updrs_3_adj'] = df['updrs_3'] + 10.3 * df['on_medication']
    
    return df
```

### Modeling Approach
1. **Baseline Model**: LightGBM with:
   - O00391 raw values and trajectory slopes
   - P05067 values and stability metrics
   - UPDRS3 medication-adjusted targets

## Training Pipeline Implementation

### Core Components
1. **Time-Series Cross Validation**
   - 5 temporal splits preserving time ordering
   - Prevents data leakage from future to past
   - Each validation set follows its training set chronologically

2. **Clinical Evaluation Metrics**
   ```python
   def clinical_smape(y_true, y_pred):
       '''Weighted SMAPE emphasizing clinical significance'''
       error = 2 * abs(y_true - y_pred) / (abs(y_true) + abs(y_pred))
       weights = np.where(y_true > 25, 1.5, 1.0)  # Higher weight for severe cases
       return np.mean(error * weights) * 100
   ```

3. **Model Persistence**
   - Best model saved as `modeling/models/best_lgbm.pkl`
   - Includes:
     - Trained weights
     - Feature importance
     - Validation scores

4. **Configuration Integration**
   - All parameters loaded from `lgbm_params.yaml`
   - Centralized control of:
     - Learning parameters
     - Tree structure
     - Regularization

## The Training Triumph (2025-06-02)

**A Day of Validation**:
The training results came in like medical test results - some expected, some surprising. Our medication-adjusted UPDRS3 model performed remarkably well (22.39% MAE), while UPDRS4 proved more stubborn (104.37% MAE). The numbers told a story beyond metrics - they revealed which symptoms our models could reliably predict and which remained medical mysteries.

**Technical Journey**:
1. **The Path Fix**: We smoothed out Windows path handling like clearing a blocked artery
2. **Memory Diet**: Optimized memory usage to keep the training pipeline lean
3. **Categorical Enlightenment**: Added proper encoding for our protein biomarkers
4. **API Harmony**: Resolved LightGBM compatibility issues through careful version tuning

**Clinical Implications**:
- The strong UPDRS3_adj performance suggests medication state is crucial for prediction
- UPDRS4's challenges may reflect its complex relationship with disease duration
